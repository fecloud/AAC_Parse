Audio Data Transport Stream (ADTS) is a format, used by MPEG TS or Shoutcast to stream audio, usually AAC.

AAAAAAAA AAAABCCD EEFFFFGH HHIJKLMM MMMMMMMM MMMOOOOO OOOOOOPP (QQQQQQQQ QQQQQQQQ)

Header consists of 7 or 9 bytes (without or with CRC).

Letter	Length (bits)	Description
A	12	syncword 0xFFF, all bits must be 1
B	1	MPEG Version: 0 for MPEG-4, 1 for MPEG-2
C	2	Layer: always 0
D	1	protection absent, Warning, set to 1 if there is no CRC and 0 if there is CRC
E	2	profile, the MPEG-4 Audio Object Type minus 1
F	4	MPEG-4 Sampling Frequency Index (15 is forbidden)
G	1	private bit, guaranteed never to be used by MPEG, set to 0 when encoding, ignore when decoding
H	3	MPEG-4 Channel Configuration (in the case of 0, the channel configuration is sent via an inband PCE)
I	1	originality, set to 0 when encoding, ignore when decoding
J	1	home, set to 0 when encoding, ignore when decoding
K	1	copyrighted id bit, the next bit of a centrally registered copyright identifier, set to 0 when encoding, ignore when decoding
L	1	copyright id start, signals that this frame's copyright id bit is the first bit of the copyright id, set to 0 when encoding, ignore when decoding
M	13	frame length, this value must include 7 or 9 bytes of header length: FrameLength = (ProtectionAbsent == 1 ? 7 : 9) + size(AACFrame)
O	11	Buffer fullness
P	2	Number of AAC frames (RDBs) in ADTS frame minus 1, for maximum compatibility always use 1 AAC frame per ADTS frame
Q	16	CRC if protection absent is 0
